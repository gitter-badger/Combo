<h3>Welcome to Combo.</h3>

<p>Combo is a simple card-matching game. You match three cards at a time until the deck runs out.</p>

<p>The deck consists of 81 cards varying in four features: number (single, double, or triple); symbol (diamond, rectangle, oval); shading (dark, light, or none); and color (red, green, or blue). Each possible combination of features appears precisely once in the deck. Given any two cards from the deck, there will be one and only one other card that forms a set with them.</p>

<p>A set consists of three cards which satisfy all of these conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>They all have the same number, or they have three different numbers. 
<li>They all have the same symbol, or they have three different symbols. 
<li>They all have the same shading, or they have three different shadings. 
<li>They all have the same color, or they have three different colors. 
</ul>

<p><b>Useful hint</b>: if you can't find a set, Combo will show you one if you swipe across the screen from left to right.</p>
