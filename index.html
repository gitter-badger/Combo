<h2>Welcome to Combo!</h2>

<p>Combo is a simple card-matching game. The basic idea is to match three cards at a time until the deck runs out.</p>

<p>The deck consists of 81 cards. Each card has a unique geometric pattern. The patterns vary in four ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shape (diamond, rectangle, oval)
<li>Count (one, two, or three)
<li>Shading (dark, light, or none)
<li>Color (red, green, or blue)
</ul>

<p>Given any two cards from the deck, there will be one and only one other card
that forms a <b>set</b> with them. What is a set? A set consists of three cards which
satisfy all of these conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>All cards have the same shape, or they have three different shapes. 
<li>All cards have the same count, or they have three different counts.
<li>All cards use the same shading, or they have three different shadings.
<li>All cards have the same color, or they have three different colors.
</ul>

<p>Combo displays 12 cards at a time. Your job is to find a set and tap on the
three cards one at a time. If you are correct, Combo replaces them with three
new cards from the deck. When the deck runs out and there are no more sets, the
game is over.</p>

<h4>Useful Hint</h4>

<p>If you're stuck and can't find a set, Combo will show you one if you swipe across the screen from left to right.</p>
